# Leadership Board

## Purpose
This project implements a leadership board system using Python. It allows for tracking and ranking participants based on their scores, providing functionality to add new entries, update scores, and retrieve the current rankings.

## How to Build
1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python leadership-board.py
   ```

## Example Output
When you run the script, you might see output similar to this:

```
Confidence Score: 85/100
Execution: The proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to establish a premier developer training and design assistance hub. The execution plan is well-structured, focusing on key areas such as developing an interactive training portal, implementing a mentorship program, standardizing coding and design practices, and creating feedback loops for continuous improvement. The plan also includes marketing and internal promotion to ensure buy-in and highlight successes. The proposal is detailed and covers various aspects necessary for successful implementation, including content development, mentorship frameworks, and standardization processes.
Risks: 1. **Resource Allocation:** The proposal requires significant resources in terms of budget, personnel, and time. There is a risk of resource constraints impacting the development and implementation of the training portal and mentorship program.

2. **Adoption and Engagement:** There is a risk that employees may not fully engage with the new training and mentorship programs, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

3. **Content Relevance:** Ensuring that training content remains up-to-date with industry standards and technologies is a continuous challenge.

4. **Cultural Resistance:** There may be resistance to change from employees accustomed to existing practices, which could hinder the adoption of new standards and practices.
Mitigation: 1. **Resource Allocation:** Prioritize key components such as the training portal and mentorship program to ensure they are developed first. Seek additional funding or reallocate existing resources to support the initiative.

2. **Adoption and Engagement:** Introduce incentives and recognition programs to encourage participation. Regularly communicate the benefits and successes of the program to maintain interest and engagement.

3. **Content Relevance:** Establish a dedicated team responsible for regularly updating training materials and incorporating feedback from industry experts to ensure content remains relevant.

4. **Cultural Resistance:** Conduct change management workshops and involve employees in the development of new standards to foster a sense of ownership and reduce resistance.
